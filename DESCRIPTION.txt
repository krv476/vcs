This is a simple terminal that can execute linux commands, has a simple game, calculator and a bit more.

To run:
	Simply compile in linux and you will be good to go!

Challenges:
	The linux commands took me a while to do. I was trying to do them on windows till I remembered that it is not possible to execute
	them on windows. It did not take me long to figure it out after.
	The terminal also wanted to never exit and I could not figure out why, it was a simple error that I overlooked.

Relation to OS:
	Every operating system has some kind of terminal or command line that comes with it.
